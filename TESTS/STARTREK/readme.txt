The famous game STAR TREK

First, I wanted only to test my new HiTech C compiler... but then I decided to (re)build this old game.

Thanks to Alan Cox, I had a very good starting source file, I split-it in two, modified-it a little, and... it works.

The files st.doc, st.int, st.fat, st.log must be copied to the drive containing the STARTREK.COM file

Enjoy!
