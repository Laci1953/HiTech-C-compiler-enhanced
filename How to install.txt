Here are the necessary 3 steps:

1. The boot (E)EPROM

This is a mandatory step only for computers provided with the 512KB ROM + 512KB RAM board.
(For computers provided with Steve Cousins SCM, e.g. SC108, this step is not mandatory, you can boot CP/M from SCM, so go to step 2)

Choose the appropriate .hex file (according to your RC2014's serial type & CF size), and burn-it to an (E)EPROM, then insert the EPROM to your 512KB RAM + 512KB ROM board.
Example: you have a Z80 computer with an ACIA serial and 64MB CF. You will choose the ACIA_PutSys_CF64_CPM_DA00H.hex file.
Now, at power ON, the CP/M directly boots.

2. The smaller CP/M (for 128KB RAM Z80 computers)

This step is mandatory only for 128KB RAM computers.
(For computers provided with 512KB RAM + 512KB ROM boards, go to step 3)

To change your CP/M with the smaller CP/M, to be able to run the enhanced HiTech C for 128KB RAM Z80 computers, 
(let's say you have a SC108, running SCM, and you want to store the smaller CP/M on a 512KB RAM Z80 computer provided with ACIA and 64MB CF)

On the SC108 computer, insert in the CF board the CF to be used on the 512KB RAM machine, boot, paste on the terminal the ACIA_PutSys_CF64_CPM_DA00H.hex file, then:

*g8000<CR>

Now, the CF contains a CP/M to be used on your 512KB RAM computer, you will need to move the CF on that machine.

3. The enhanced HiTech C

This step is mandatory for all computers.

To implement on your computer the enhanced HiTech C, you need to copy the appropriate .HEX files (according to your hardware), here I will use the "generic" names, then execute:

LOAD CPP
LOAD P1
LOAD CGEN
LOAD OPTIM
LOAD Z80AS
PIP ZAS.COM=Z80AS.COM

Now, you have the enhanced HiTech C installed.
