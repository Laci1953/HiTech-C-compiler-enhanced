Here are the necessary 3 steps:

1. The boot (E)EPROM

This is a mandatory step only for computers provided with the 512KB ROM + 512KB RAM board.
(For computers provided with Steve Cousins SCM, e.g. SC108, this step is not mandatory, you can boot CP/M from SCM, so go to step 2)

Choose the appropriate .hex file (according to your RC2014's serial type & CF size), and burn-it to an (E)EPROM, then insert the EPROM to your 512KB RAM + 512KB ROM board.
Example: you have a Z80 computer with an ACIA serial and 64MB CF. You will choose the CPM_boot_512_ACIA_CF64.hex file.
Now, at power ON, the CP/M directly boots.

2. The smaller CP/M (for 128KB RAM Z80 computers)

This step is mandatory only for 128KB RAM computers.
(For computers provided with 512KB RAM + 512KB ROM boards, you may use the "original" CP/M, go to step 3)

To change your CP/M with the smaller CP/M, to be able to run the enhanced HiTech C for 128KB RAM Z80 computers, you need to 
paste on the terminal the appropriate .hex file.
Example: you have an 128KB RAM Z80 computer with an ACIA serial and 64MB CF. You will choose the ACIA_PutSys_CF64_CPM_DA00H.hex file.

Then:
*g8000<CR>

Now, the CF contains a smaller CP/M.

3. The enhanced HiTech C

This step is mandatory for all computers.

To implement on your computer the enhanced HiTech C, you need to copy the appropriate .HEX files (according to your hardware), here I will use the "generic" names, then execute:

LOAD CPP
LOAD P1
LOAD CGEN
LOAD OPTIM
LOAD Z80AS
PIP ZAS.COM=Z80AS.COM

Now, you have the enhanced HiTech C installed.
