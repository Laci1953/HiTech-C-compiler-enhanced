Improvement for the OPTIM.COM for RC2014's provided with 128 KB RAM (SC108, SC114, SC118 or Phillip Stevens memory module).

Enables OPTIM.COM to process larger files, compared to the original version.

Works ONLY for systems provided with both:

- 128 KB RAM (SC108, SC114, SC118 or Phillip Stevens memory module)
- CP/M from the folder PutSys 

Best results are obtained with RC2014's provided with 64MB CF, due to larger TPA.

The executable is OPTIM128.COM

Current settings are made for SC108

You may change settings in myalloc.as, to choose SC114, SC118 or Phillip Stevens memory module.

Use -n option to get optimization statistics, including upper RAM usage
