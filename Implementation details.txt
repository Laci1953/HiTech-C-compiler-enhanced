Hardware requirements
-------------------------------

The improved HiTech C compiler works on any Z80-based system provided with one of the following RAM modules:

- 128 KB RAM (2 x 64KB : SC108, SC114, SC118, SC150, SC152 or the Phillip Stevens’s memory module, or RCBUS-based systems provided with SC707, SC714, or 4 x 32KB : Bill Shen's Z80ALL)

- 512 KB RAM (512 KB RAM + 512 KB ROM Spencer Owen’s module)

Software requirements
------------------------------

For the 2 x 64KB version, a customised CP/M is needed (one with a smaller BIOS). 

Why is this a mandatory constraint? 
Because it is vital for the C compiler to access the upper 64KB RAM in order to “gain” more available memory where to store its various data structures used by its routines.
But, in order to access the upper 64KB RAM, a small piece of code must be stored in memory as high as possible, in both the lower and the upper 64KB RAM, at exactly the same address. 
This “shadow” code will be responsible to move bytes between these two 64KB RAM partitions. 
Unfortunately, the “official” BIOS delivered with the RC2014 is too big, “eating” all the available RAM space until the end of the physical 64K memory space. 
Thus, no space is left for the “shadow” code.
The only possible solution was to build a custom, smaller BIOS.

You can find the customised CP/M’s here: https://github.com/Laci1953/HiTech-C-compiler-enhanced/tree/main/PutSys - the folder contains all the possible CP/M variants according to the needed serial type (SIO, KIO, ACIA) and CF size (64MB or 128MB).

For the 512KB version and the 4 x 32KB version, no CP/M customization is needed.

One last remark: the 64MB CF’s CP/M is preferable because it allows a larger TPA ( 2 and half KB larger compared to the 128MB CF version, who “eats” more buffer space needed by the extra disk drives ... ) ; 

Design details
-------------------

The customised HiTech C compiler components (P1, CGEN, OPTIM) use now two kinds of memory allocation routines: 
- the classical “malloc”
- the new memory allocation routine, allowing access to the extra RAM provided by the hadware

For the 128KB version, a custom memory allocator was built (assembler). This made possible accessing an extra 64KB RAM area, compared to the “classic” TPA area.

For the 512KB version, another memory allocator was built (assembler), allowing access to at least extra 256 KB RAM.

For both 128KB and 512KB versions, code was kept small also by using a special psect, named “top”, placed after the BSS psect; this “top” psect contains code that is executed only once, at initialization time, and then can be “dropped”, the “top” psect practically is being overwritten by subsequent malloc’s.

Practical results
---------------------

Both the 128KB and 512KB HiTech C compiler custom versions outperform the old 64KB version, allowing to compile quite large C source files.

See the TESTS folder for examples of large C source files that can now be compiled, but will fail with the old HiTech C compiler.
