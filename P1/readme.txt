The folder contains new P1 version, for 128KB RAM RC2014 systems

To gain RAM space, I changed a lot of warning/error message calls, using a simpler (and shorter...) message containing only an error index instead of the original error/warning text (of course, a numbered list of error/warning messages is provided) ; I kept all fatal error messages untouched...

It improves the old P1 version, allowing processing of larger C files.

The P1v128.COM is configured for SC108.
