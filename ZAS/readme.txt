Enhanced ZAS, provided to be used when assembling files generated by the C compiler.

It is able to assemble huge Z80 assembler source files.

The labels are now stored to the extended RAM.

IMPORTANT NOTE:

This version of ZAS must be used only when called from the C compiler (after CPP, P1, CGEN and OPTIM)

To assemble Z80 source files, outside the framework provided by the C compiler, 
you may still use Z80AS ( https://github.com/Laci1953/Z80AS ).
